## Overview

WLS is a small, light app for creating your own custom plain White page of Links to Start from.
It's a minimalist My Yahoo. Development is still underway.


## Browser Support
This application uses the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) ([spec](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/)), which is not supported by some browsers (notably, Safari). There is a [polyfill](https://github.com/github/fetch) that I choose not to use at this time.


## Symlink to data repo
The data repo had made purposely made as a separate item.
`ln -s /path/to/file /path/to/symlink`
`ln -sf /path/to/file /path/to/symlink`
